# NU Life Gym website

## Milestone one project for code institute User Centric Frontend Development

The website I have created is based upon a ficticious independent family orientated gym looking to create an online presence to help generate more memberships and show the world who they are.
The website focuses on a family friendly environment, helping families stay healthy together.
As it is a family orientated gym I have envisioned each age group of a typical family to highlight what they may expect or would want from a gym of this nature.

# User Stories
### The parent

* As an actor playing the role of a parent, I would want a safe and trusting environment for the whole of my family that also offers a good value for money for the family membership.
* As it is a family membership I would like to see what is available for each member of my family making sure they are able to make use of the facilities.
* I also have a very young child who may not be able to use the facilities and I cannot put them in child care, does the gym offer some sort of cresh/child care while the older members of the family can use the gym?
* Are they exercise classes available and are they open to all ages? I would like to do classes so I would like to see a schedule to to see I can attend these.
* Does the gym offer a personal trainer as part of the package or is there an option to add this to help with a routine. If so can they offer a healthy eating plan.
* What time is the gym open and can I only go at certain times as I work full time and may be limited to times I can go. I would also like to know where it is based so I dont have to travel too far.

### The Child (8+)

* As an actor playing the role of a yound child, I would want to know if there are any fun groups or classes I can attend to exercise and learn to be healthy, preferrably with people of a simular age.
* Is there a pool at the gym as I enjoy swimming and some of my friends may not be able to swim yet so are there swimming lessons available?
* Can I be taught and shown how to use the gym equipment as I have never been in a gym before

### The very Young Child, Toddler, even baby

* Thinking on this age group who may be too young to safely use the facilities, they may require other needs while the other family member do.
* Will child care be availble as part of the gym membership and will the staff be trained and trusting
* If there is a pool, maybe there are lessons and even a parents and Toddler only session
* A supervised cresh/play area for the younger children to be while the gym is used by the parents and older family members.

### Ederly (60+)

* As an actor playing this age group I may prefer to only use the gym earlier in the day and with a group of people who are my age. Is this an option?
* I may want to try a class instead of using the equipment, will there be one I can attend that may be slower and more in tune with someone my age
* I may need some help with accessabilty for parking, entry or inside the changing rooms when showering. Do you facilitate this?
* Are there good and well trained medical practices by the staff on site should anything untoward happen?
